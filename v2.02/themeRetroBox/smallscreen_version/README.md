## Acknowledgments

- Inspired by old console poster designs (see: http://imgur.com/J4eeTun and http://imgur.com/Ut0SWfJ for examples)
- All Logo graphics are from the default Carbom theme made by Eric Hettervik (see: https://github.com/RetroPie/es-theme-carbon/)
- Static.mp4 default video from OldRoom theme by Nismo (see: https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/5823/looking-for-testers-for-es-video-preview-on-raspberry-pi/20)
- Video support possible because of work done by fieldofcows (see: https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/4820/video-preview-in-emulationstation)
- Theme tutorial written by mattrixk was a huge help in learning how to build this (see: https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki/Creating-Your-Own-EmulationStation-Theme)
